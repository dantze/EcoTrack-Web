/**
 * Runtime configuration.
 *
 * The app runs in one of two data modes, chosen at build time by VITE_DATA_MODE:
 *
 *   mock (default) — no backend needed. All API calls resolve against an
 *                    in-memory seeded dataset with simulated latency. This is
 *                    how the UI is developed and demoed.
 *   live           — calls the real Spring backend at VITE_API_BASE_URL.
 *
 * Mock is the default deliberately: the production backend is currently plain
 * HTTP on a bare IP, which a browser will refuse to call from an HTTPS origin
 * (mixed content). Live mode works from a local http://localhost dev server;
 * a deployed build needs TLS on the backend first.
